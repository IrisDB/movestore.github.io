## MoveApps User Manual

[MoveApps](https://www.moveapps.org/) serves as a platform that allows the exchange and easy use of code for the [**analysis of movement data**](https://www.moveapps.org/imprint#Scope).

Code developers are encouraged to share (a slightly adapted version of) their movement track analysis code ([How to create an R or RShiny App](create_app.md), [How to create a Python App](create_py_app.md)) which other people can then use without knowledge of programming. Users can configure and stitch together analysis Apps to create a Workflow ([How to compile a Workflow](create_workflow.md)).

Currently, we support R, R-Shiny and Python Apps. These are meant to be provided in such a way that standard movement data sets of animals or other moving objects can be analysed. It is possible to directly download and analyse data from the [Movebank database](http://www.movebank.org).

## MoveApps Documentation

MoveApps serves as a platform that allows the exchange and easy use of code for the  [**analysis of movement data**](scope.md).

Code developers are encouraged to share (a slightly adapted version of) their movement track analysis code ([How to create your own App](create_app.md)) which then other people can use without knowledge of programming. Users can configure and stitch together analysis Apps to create a Workflow ([How to compile a Workflow](create_workflow.md)).

Presently, we support R and R-Shiny Apps. These are meant to be provided in such a way that standard Movement data sets of animals or other moving objects can be analysed. It is possible to directly download and analyse data from the [Movebank database](http://www.movebank.org).

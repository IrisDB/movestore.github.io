## MoveApps Documentation

MoveApps is being developed to provide a platform that allows the exchange and easy use of code for analysis of tracking data. 

Code developers are encouraged to share (a slightly adapted version of) their analysis code ([How to create your own App](create_app.md)) which then other people can use without the need to know programming. The users can configure and stitch together small analysis Apps to a Workflow ([How to compile a Workflow](create_workflow.md)).

Presently, we support R and R-Shiny Apps. These are meant to be provided in such a way as that standard Movement data sets of animals or other moving objects can be analysed. It is possible to directly download and analyse data from the [Movebank database](http://www.movebank.org).

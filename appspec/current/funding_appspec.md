# Funding
To acknowledge your funding parties, please add a funding statement in the [appspec.json](appspec.md) file. It consists of a `name` and a `comment` slot that can be freely filled in. The funding statement is not mandatory.

#### Example
```json
{
  "settings": [],
  "funding": [
    {
      "name": "Your Funding Agency",
      "comment": "grant 123"
    }
  ]
}
```

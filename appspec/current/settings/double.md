# Input of real numbers
To allow the user to input real, or floating-point, numbers with decimals, you can use the type `DOUBLE`.

## Example

```json
{
  "id": "testDouble",
  "name": "Test floating-point number",
  "description": "Select a number.",
  "defaultValue": null,
  "type": "DOUBLE"
}
```

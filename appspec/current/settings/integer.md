# Input of integer numbers
To allow the user to enter integer numbers, the input type `INTEGER` can be used. Note that this is more efficient than the use of the type `DOUBLE` (for real numbers), if the value does not need the possibility of numbers with comma.


## Example

```json
{
  "id": "testNumber",
  "name": "Test Number",
  "description": "Select a number.",
  "type": "INTEGER",
  "defaultValue": null
}
```

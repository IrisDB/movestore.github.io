## Beta-Version
As of today 1 February 2021 our MoveApps Beta version is finished and available to our first users under [www.moveapps.org](www.moveapps.org). General usability has been reached and a small selection of Apps is available. We hope that the community will join us in developing and submitting more Apps, exchanging ideas and using the platform.

Please register and try out MoveApps, as an App developer or as a user, creating Workflows for your own data!

## Next steps
Based on your reports and comments, MoveApps will be made more stable and user-friendly. We will compile a list of most wanted future Apps. The addition of Apps from users will be strongly supported.

# MoveApps Scope

MoveApps serves as a platform that allows the exchange and easy use of code for the  **analysis of movement data**. 

Our **scope** is thus limited to methods for the manipulation of movement tracks for visualisation and parameter extraction to describe movement behaviours of all kinds of animals. The outcomes are meant to be used for answering biological and ecological questions as well as monitoring and management/conservation applications.

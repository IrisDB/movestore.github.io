# Data policy

MoveApps' software policy consists of our user agreement and guidance on the use of software licenses for the contributed Apps.


## User agreement

By using Apps and services available through MoveApps, users acknowledge the following:

### General

●	MoveApps developers retain ownership of their Apps that will all be made available to the registered MoveApps users.

●	MoveApps does not guarantee the completeness or accuracy of Apps available in MoveApps. Many Apps in MoveApps represent in-progress code, and thus incomplete results or error messages may appear. App performance can vary due to the operating system on which they are run, as well as software compatibilities and dependencies within Apps.

●	MoveApps does not guarantee an instant execution slot of a user’s Workflow. On heavy load it is possible that the execution is queued.

●	Apps in MoveApps are treated independently within the platform and are created and managed by users. Apps, Workflows and their names should not be assumed to be unique.

### App users

●	When using Apps developed and owned by others, users agree to comply with the [general MoveApps terms of use](terms_of_use.md) and the license terms of applicable Apps and follow MoveApps’ [citation guidelines](citation_guide.md).

### App developers

●	For all Apps, the App developer and owner agrees to provide a [detailed description and documentation](files/README_template.md) and maintain a current contact who is able to respond to questions about the App or requests for adaptation.

●	Users must be the developer and owner of, or have permission from the owner of, Apps they submit to MoveApps.

●	Users will not submit Apps that are unrelated to movement ecology, as defined in our [mission statement](scope.md).

●	Users will not knowingly submit Apps or use code in their Apps that contain malware or commands that are intended to adversely affect MoveApps' website, users or content.

●	MoveApps will assist with as feasible but not legally enforce user compliance with [data and software licenses](license.md).

### App access and use by MoveApps

●	MoveApps will not edit Apps or public Workflows without the permission of an App developer or Workflow creator.

●	MoveApps may report aggregate information about the use of MoveApps, for example the total number of submitted Apps or the number of shared or public Workflows.

●	MoveApps site administrators may query Apps or Workflows to identify errors, quality control issues, or causes of site performance problems. This information may be used to notify users with suggestions to improve user experience or the quality of Apps on MoveApps.

●	At [Workflow publication](publish_workflow.md), Apps that were selected as part of the Workflow are included in the publication. A copy of the App code and documentation will stored alongside the Workflow on the [MoveApps Repository](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/).

### Security and persistence

●	MoveApps does not guarantee uninterrupted access to Apps, Workflows or scheduled analysis runs.

●	MoveApps has long-term [funding](funding.md) and in general will not delete Apps stored on MoveApps. However, MoveApps does not guarantee permanent storage or public visibility of Apps on MoveApps, for example in cases of major errors that affect site performance.

●	Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) encryption is used on all MoveApps web pages and APIs on which data are transferred and managed.

●	MoveApps may disable user accounts if use interferes with normal operations of the website.

●	MoveApps may maintain secure back-up copies of Apps and Workflows.

●	Information about the collection, use and disclosure of personal data of site visitors and registered users is provided in our [privacy policy](privacy_policy.md).


## Software licenses

The [general MoveApps terms of use](terms_of_use.md) are applicable to the development as well as use of all Apps and Workflows stored in MoveApps.

**Choosing a license:**  For all Apps that are submitted to MoveApps, authors and owners select their preferred license agreement. If unsure please consult our [recommendations](license.md).

**Using licensed Apps:** See MoveApps' [citation guidelines](citation_guide.md) for details of how to reference Apps and their authors. Many Apps and Workflows in MoveApps have been developed by active researchers who continue to use and improve them. Licenses facilitate software re-use and improvement beyond individual careers, but **do not supersede academic and professional norms for acknowledgement, citation and authorship**. We strongly encourage users to make a reasonable attempt to contact App developers before using code to develop own, improved version thereof. App developers are interested in learning about new adaptations of their code, have important insights about how to properly interpret their App’s outcome, and might have additional code they would be willing to contribute.

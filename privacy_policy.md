# Privacy policy

This privacy policy explains which data we record when you visit or register and use our platform at [www.moveapps.org](www.moveapps.org) and how they are used. For information about how Apps and Workflows submitted by users to the MoveApps platform are treated, see MoveApps’ [user agreement](software_policy.md#User agreement].

## Summary

**The Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften e.V.) (hereafter “we”, “our” or “MPG”) takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We process personal data gathered when visiting our websites in compliance with applicable data protection legislation. We neither publish your data nor transmit them to third parties on an unauthorized basis.**


## A. General information

**1. Scope of data processing** As a matter of principle, we gather and utilize users' personal data only to the extent required to ensure the functioning of our website and of our contents and services. The gathering and utilization of our users' personal data normally occurs after users have granted their consent. An exception occurs where data processing is legally permitted.

**2. Legal basis of data processing** To the extent that permission of the affected individual is obtained for the processing of personal data, Article 6 (1) lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis. If processing is required to safeguard the justified interest of the MPG or a third party and the interests, basic rights and basic freedoms of the affected individual do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR serves as the basis for such processing.

**3. Data deletion and storage duration** The affected individual's personal data are deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of the storage ceases to apply. Storage can also occur if provided for by European or national legislators in EU regulations, acts or other legislation to which the MPG is subject. A blocking or deletion of data then occurs only if a storage period prescribed by one of the aforementioned norms expires.

For users that are registered and logged in (see section **G**), accounts and the personal data associated with those accounts cannot be automatically deleted, because it would require the deletion of associated research data, Apps and Workflows that the user has stored on MoveApps. The purpose of this data use is to pursue our and the public’s interests to make data discoverable and facilitate the sharing and joint management of data for beneficial use, including research and wildlife management and conservation (article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR). To request deletion of a user account and personal data, and the deletion or transfer of ownership of associated research data and software, contact `support@moveapps.org`.

## B. Provision of the website and creation of log files

Each time you visit our website, our service and applications automatically record data and information from the computer system of the visiting computer. The following data are gathered temporarily: 

-	Your IP address 

-	Date and time of your access to the website 

-	Name and version of your browser/operating system, if transmitted

These data are stored in our systems' log files. These data are not stored together with the user's other personal data. The legal basis for the temporary saving of data and log files is Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. Storage occurs in log files in order to ensure the website's functionality. The data also help us optimize the websites, eliminate malfunctions, improve the user experience and ensure our IT system security. Our justified interest in data processing pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR also lies in such purposes.

The data are deleted periodically. The recording of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is essential to operate the website. As a consequence, users do not have an option to revoke such data recording.

The processing is necessary to pursue our interests in communicating with our network, App and Workflow authors, and the public in general (article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR).


## G. Registration

-	If the user has submitted own Apps to the MoveApps platform, his Nickname can be displayed as App author in an App Showcase on the public part of www.moveapps.org.

The purpose of this data use is to pursue our and the public’s interests to make data analysis methods discoverable and facilitate the sharing of analysis methods and collaborative data analysis for beneficial use, including research and wildlife management and conservation (article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR). Beyond what is described above, the Max-Planck-Society does not share lists of users or contact information and does not sell user data to third parties.

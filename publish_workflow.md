# Publication of Workflows

To make your work reproducible, we offer the publication of Workflows in combination with published papers and data sets.

## Publication with DOI
If you plan a publication of your Workflow in a scientific paper, there is the additional option of aquiring a DOI for your Workflow. Thereby, your Workflow will become permanently reproducible. The providion of a DOI is provided by the Communication, Information and Media Centre (KIM) of the University of Konstanz and requires the publication of the related data in the [Movebank Data Repository](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/). Please contact [mdr.kim@uni-konstanz.de](mdr.kim@uni-konstanz.de).

## How to export/publish your Workflow
In order to have all the required information for the publication of a Workflow gathered, please complete the `Publish` dialog that you can access via the Workflow menu in the Workflow overview. Carefully follow the provided instructions and select Workflow instances to be included. Once you are finished press `Save and publish` and a message with all relevant information will be sent to our data repository and we will come back to you about it personally.

#### License
Chose a license under which you want to share/publish your Workflow and which users of it must abide to. See [our recommendations](license.md) as help for your selection.

#### Keywords

# Publication of Workflows

!> **_NOTE:_**  This feature isn't yet available. We plan on implementing it during spring/summer 2021. Stay tuned!

To make your work reproducible, we offer the publication of Workflows in combination with published papers and data sets.

## Publication with DOI
If you plan a publication of your Workflow in a scientific paper, there is the additional option of aquiring a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for your Workflow. Thereby, your Workflow will become permanently reproducible. The provision of a DOI is arranged by the Communication, Information and Media Centre (KIM) of the University of Konstanz and requires the publication of the related data in the [Movebank Data Repository](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/). Please contact [mdr.kim@uni-konstanz.de](mdr.kim@uni-konstanz.de).

## How to publish your Workflow
In order to have all the required information for the publication of a Workflow gathered, please complete the `Publish` dialog that you can access via the Workflow menu in the Workflow overview. Carefully follow the provided instructions and select Workflow instances to be included. Once you are finished press `Save & Publish` and a message with all relevant information will be sent to our data repository and we will come back to you about it personally.

## Information required for Publication
For publication of your Workflow, information about the Workflow, included Apps, liceses, authors and other properties are required. All properties of the Apps are automatically taken from the App submission properties and the [appspec.json](appspec.md). In addition, you will provide the following information at publication, if not already provided at the initiation of the Workflow / Workflow Instance.

#### Workflow title
Please name your Workflow with a meaningful title. This will help other users to understand the scope of and the idea behind your Workflow.

#### Workflow description
Please write a detailed description of the Workflow, what you have created it for, how and why the Apps and their settings were chosen and which conclusions you draw from the results. Also add suggestions for further use and point out possible limitations.

#### Workflow instance title & description
You can include one or several instances of your Workflow in a publication. Please name each of those with a meaningful title as well as enrich it with a description. You can use this description to let people know how each of your instance configurations differ from one another.

#### Workflow contributors
List the names and affiliation of all authors and other contributors to the Workflow.

#### Keywords
Add a list of keywords that describe your Workflow so that it can easily be found by other users.

#### License
Chose a license under which you want to share/publish your Workflow and which users of it must abide to. See [our recommendations](license.md) as help for your selection.

# Publication of Workflows

To make your work reproducible, we allow the publication of workflows with a DOI. That includes the list and order of combined Apps, the selected Settings and is in some way dependent on the input data set. This publication will be supported by our library and is an automatic process.

## Information required for Publication
To have your Workflow officially published, a standard list of information about the Workflow, its comprising Apps, license, contributors and other properties are required. All properties of the Apps are automatically taken from the App submission properties and the [appspec.json](appspec.md). In addition, you have to provide the following information at publication, if not already provided at the initiation of the Workflow / Workflow Instance.

### Workflow description

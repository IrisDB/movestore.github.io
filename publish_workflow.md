# Publication of Workflows

To make your work reproducible, we allow the publication of workflows with a DOI. A published Workflow includes the list and order of combined Apps, the selected Settings, and information about the data input. This publication will be supported by our library and is an automated process.

## Information required for Publication
To publish your Workflow, you will provide a standard list of information about the Workflow, Apps included, licenses, contributors and other properties. All properties of the Apps are automatically taken from the App submission properties and the [appspec.json](appspec.md). In addition, you will provide the following information at publication, if not already provided at the initiation of the Workflow / Workflow Instance.

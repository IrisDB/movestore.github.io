# Citation of Apps

For recognition, trackability and documentation, Apps that are running on MoveApps can be cited. By pressing the BUTTON X (NOT YET, in App properties of owner, in App properties if want to select for WF??) you are provided with suggestions of a formatted citation in different styles.

## Information required for Citation provision
To have your App  cited in the most widely recognised styles, information about the App, its authors and other properties are required.

### Properties that are required at submission
At creation of a new App, you are required to enter a name, description, Runtime Environment, inputType and outputType of your App. This information is used for running the App and its citation. Furthermore, MoveApps automatically saves the date of App creation and the GitHub link of the App files.

### Properties entered in the appspec.json
Most properties that can change depending on App version have to be entered in the [appspec.json](appspec.md). These are dependencies, language, license, author details, funding specifics, keywords and references. Of these, the provision of a language, a license, an author and at least one keyword is mandatory. Please see the [appspec.json](appspec.md) documentation for details of possible values for language, license and reference type. If mandatory fields are not provided or values for language, license and reference type are not as listed, an error will be thrown at App submission.

# Appspec.json

The `appspec.json` file is used to define an App within MoveApps.
Here, dependencies, settings and documentation properties of the App are defined. Some of the settings are mandatory and have a fixed list of possible values, others are optional.


## Validator

For creation, test and verification of the `appspec.json` there is
the [Settings Editor](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/settingseditor ':ignore'). With its help you can quickly and easily
define and visualise your settings. If errors occur, suggestions for improvement are given in the window on the right side.

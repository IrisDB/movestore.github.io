# Appspec.json

The `appspec.json` file is used to define the specifications of an App within MoveApps. Here, settings, depencencies and other properties of the App are defined. Some of the specifications are mandatory and have a fixed list of possible values, others are optional. Take a look at the menu on the left for detailed descriptions and guidelines for each of the specifications that can be defined.

Currently, the following specifications can/need to be added:
- [Settings](appspec/current/settings/README.md)
- [Dependencies](appspec/current/dependencies_appspec.md)
- [License](appspec/current/license_appspec.md)
- [Language](appspec/current/language_appspec.md)
- [Keywords](appspec/current/keywords_appspec.md)
- [People](appspec/current/people_appspec.md)
- [Funding](appspec/current/funding_appspec.md)
- [References](appspec/current/references_appspec.md)

Please take a look at the descriptions for all of the specifications.

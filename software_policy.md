# Software policy

MoveApps' software policy consists of our user agreement and guidance on the use of software licenses for the contributed Apps and Workflows.


### Definitions

**MoveApps/MoveApps platform:** A web-based software platform accessible via [www.moveapps.org](www.moveapps.org), developed and owned by the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior (MPIAB), Department of Migration.

The Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior is a legally dependent institution under public law of the Max-Planck-Society e.V.

**Apps:** Software modules developed and owned by App developers, not MoveApps. Rights to use, reproduce, combine and share are granted to third parties according to the selected license terms.

**Workflows:** Ordered list of Apps, incl. settings for each App, that is intended for a specific analysis.

**www.moveapps.org:** Website containing the MoveApps platform where users can share Apps and Workflows and use them for data analysis and other services of MoveApps, hosted by MPIAB.

**App developer:** Any author of an App that is (to be) submitted and potentially used by others on the MoveApps platform.
App user: Any registered person, who has accepted these terms that is utilising Apps in Workflows on the MoveApps platform.


## User agreement

By using Apps, Workflows and services available through MoveApps, users agree to the following terms:

### General
-	You may use the MoveApps platform, Apps, Workflows and services as follows:

   * You may access the software functionalities of the MoveApps platform through the website www.moveapps.org via your personal access.
 
   * The use of the MoveApps platform under this agreement is currently free of charge. This is subject to change with further notice at least two weeks in advance.

   * You may use all available Apps and combine them to Workflows with your own settings. These Workflows can be shared with others or published under open licenses. 

   * You may use your Workflows or those shared by others to analyse your own movement data or data that others have given you permission to use.

   * You may submit your own Apps, or those for which the owner has given you permission, to the MoveApps platform to be utilised by all users under your selected open license.

   * The Apps to be submitted to the MoveApps platform have to be developed on your personal Git repository. The files that define the App must be prepared according to our [documentation](https://docs.moveapps.org)

-	Each App developer retains ownership and copyright of his/her App(s) that will be made available under a selected open license to all registered MoveApps users.

-	MoveApps does not warrant for the completeness or accuracy of Apps available on the MoveApps platform. Many Apps in MoveApps represent in-progress code, and thus incomplete results or error messages may appear. App performance can vary due to the operating system on which they are run, as well as software compatibilities and dependencies within Apps.

-	MoveApps does not warrant for an instant execution slot of a user’s Workflow. On heavy load it is possible that the execution is queued.

-	Apps and Workflows on the MoveApps platform are treated independently within the platform and are created and managed by users. Apps, Workflows and their names should not be assumed to be unique. 

-	MoveApps retains the right to change these terms in part or total for the future with notice reasonable time in advance. 

-	MoveApps has the right to terminate the MoveApps platform in part or total. This can affect certain or all users. Notice will be given reasonable time in advance.


### App users

-	When using Apps  developed and owned by others, users agree to comply with the [general MoveApps terms](terms_of_use.md) and the [license terms](license.md) of the Apps, and follow MoveApps’ [citation guidelines](citation_guide.md).

### App developers

-	For all Apps, the App developer shall provide a detailed and complete [description and documentation](files/README_template.md) and maintain a current contact who is able to respond to questions about the App or requests for adaptation.

-	App developers must be the developer and owner of, or have permission from the owner of, Apps they submit to www.moveapps.org.

-	App developers will not submit Apps that are unrelated to movement ecology, as defined in our [scope statement](imprint.md#Scope).

-	App developers will not knowingly submit Apps or use code in their Apps that contain malware or commands that adversely affect MoveApps' website, users or content.

-	MoveApps can but is not obligated to assist with the legal enforcement of user compliance with software licenses of Apps through the MoveApps platform.

### App access and use by MoveApps

-	MoveApps will not edit Apps or public Workflows without the permission of an App developer or Workflow creator.

-	MoveApps may report aggregate information about the use of MoveApps, for example the total number of submitted Apps or the number of shared or public Workflows.

-	MoveApps site administrators may query Apps or Workflows to identify errors, quality control issues, or causes of site performance problems. This information may be used to notify users with suggestions to improve user experience or the quality of Apps and Workflows on MoveApps.

-	At [Workflow publication](publish_workflow.md), Apps that were selected as part of the Workflow are included in the publication. A copy of the App code and documentation will be stored alongside the Workflow on the [Movebank Data Repository](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/).

### Security and persistence

-	MoveApps does not warrant for uninterrupted access to Apps, Workflows or scheduled analysis runs.

-	MoveApps has long-term [funding](imprint.md#Funding) and in general will not delete Apps stored on www.moveapps.org. However, MoveApps does not warrant permanent storage or public visibility of Apps on www.moveapps.org, for example in cases of major errors that affect site performance.

-	Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) encryption is used on all MoveApps web pages and APIs on which data are transferred and managed.

-	MoveApps may disable user accounts if use interferes with normal operations of the website.

-	MoveApps may maintain secure back-up copies of Apps and Workflows.

-	Information about the collection, use and disclosure of personal data of site visitors and registered users is provided in our [privacy policy](privacy_policy.md).


## Software licenses

The [general MoveApps terms](terms_of_use.md) are applicable to the development as well as use of all Apps and Workflows stored in MoveApps.

**Choosing a license:**  For all Apps that are submitted to www.moveapps.org, authors and owners must select their preferred open license agreement out of the five possibilities listed below. Apps cannot be submitted if they do not contain a notice of the applicable license.  For details of each license please consult our [recommendations](licsense.md).

-	GNU General Public License version 3
-	MIT License
-	GNU Affero General Public License
-	3-Clause BSD License
-	Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International

**Using licensed Apps:** You shall only use the Apps under the conditions of the respective license. See MoveApps' [citation guidelines](citation_guide.md) for details of how to reference Apps and their authors. Many Apps and Workflows on the MoveApps platform have been developed by active researchers who continue to use and improve them. Licenses facilitate software re-use and improvement beyond individual careers, but **do not supersede academic and professional norms for acknowledgement, citation and authorship**. We strongly encourage users to make a reasonable attempt to contact App developers before using code to develop own, improved versions thereof. App developers are interested in learning about new adaptations of their code, have important insights about how to properly interpret their App’s outcome and might have additional code they would be willing to contribute.

Motivated by having been named a [Conservation Tech Award grantee in 2022](https://www.earthranger.com/news/conservation-tech-award-2022), we have recently held the EMAC23 coding challenge and workshop to Equip MoveApps for Conservation.

Working on [five use cases](EMAC23_CodingChallenge_Details3.pdf) many <code>R</code> and <code>Python</code> developers have submitted Apps and joined the September workshop at the [Max-Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/) in Germany. People of largely various backgrounds have joined to workshop, from hobby-coders with an interest in conservation to movement ecology PostDocs. We are very excited to now call them our first App development community and are grateful for all their ideas, thoughts and feedback during the workshop. Look forward to continue working with you all!

The workshop was funded by [AI2â€™s EarthRanger](https://www.earthranger.com/) and the [Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/).

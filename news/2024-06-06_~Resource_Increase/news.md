# MoveApps Resource Increase

![Resource Increase Visualisation](more_resources2.jpg)

The number of registered MoveApps users had increased over the past years to well above 1,000 and the complexity of contributed Apps and Workflows is contantly increasing. We are thrilled to announce this positive development. To react on the increasing demand, we were finally able to move the platform to high performance server space. As a consequence, all Apps are now granted significantly more memory, so larger data sets and more complex analyses should be able to run smoothly.

We are extremely grateful to the [Max Planck Computing and Data Centre](https://www.mpcdf.mpg.de/) and [couchbits GmbH](https://www.couchbits.com/) for the system transition and maintenance. Thanks!

If any Workflows or Apps show strange behaviour or repeatedly run into "killed" states, please [let us know](mailto:info@moveapps.org).

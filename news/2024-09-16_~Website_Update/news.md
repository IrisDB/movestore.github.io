# MoveApps Website Update

![Website Update](ui_tutorial.jpg)

We have updated our website! We have kept the same appearance were possible, but small changes had to be made. All functionalities should be exactly the same. If you encounter any strange behavior or missing functionalities, please [let us know](mailto:info@moveapps.org).

We have also have updated the User Manual and restructured it. Hopefully now it is more intuitive and easier to find all the information. If you are missing information about a specific topic, please [let us know](mailto:info@moveapps.org).

Check out our brand new [video tutorials](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/video_tutorials) introducing MoveApps, and live demos on how to analyse data and how to create an App.

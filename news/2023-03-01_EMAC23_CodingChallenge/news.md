![logo](logo_EMAC23_lowres.jpng)

Motivated by having been named a [Conservation Tech Award grantee in 2022](https://www.earthranger.com/news/conservation-tech-award-2022), we are launching the EMAC23 coding challenge to Equip MoveApps for Conservation.

Pick one of [five use cases](EMAC23_CodingChallenge_Details2.pdf) related to pressing conservation challenges, use recommended datasets and develop creative [App code](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/) using <code>R</code> or <code>Python</code>. Fill in our [Registration form](https://survey.academiccloud.de/index.php/146231?lang=en), initialise your App on [MoveApps](http://moveapps.org) and submit a functioning version by 31 May 2023.

Developers of the 10 best Apps will be invited to join the EMAC23 workshop at the [Max-Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/) in Germany, fully paid by our funds (provided by [AI2’s EarthRanger](https://www.earthranger.com/) and the [Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/)). We look forward to meeting you!

MoveApps has initiated a [Github Discussion Forum](https://github.com/movestore/moveapps_forum/discussions) for any user or App developer to (i) give feedback to us in a findable manner and (ii) connect with each other. 
Use it to post your ecological use cases, App developers need details to start digging to the code. Use it to discuss new methods or App ideas that you have set up and want to have feedback about. Become buddies. Tell us about your latest achievement on the platform or join in any other interactions with the community!
We sincerely hope that this Forum will become more and more used, helpful for all and increase community interaction. Let's get together!

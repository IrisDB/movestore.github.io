# Become a test user!

## Testing, testing, testing
Please help us make MoveApps more usable, intuitive, well-functioning and error-less. Test selected Workflows, Apps, general performance and give us detailed feedback under `support@moveapps.org`.

## Use cases
Let us know who you are and how you are interested in using MoveApps for your projects. Are there any more general use cases that would be interesting for a wider audience?

## Publishing
Our Apps will be citable in a standard way and Workflows can be published  with DOI if related to a published paper and data set. Would that be interesting for you and why?

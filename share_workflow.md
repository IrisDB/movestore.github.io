# Share Workflows with other Users

For replication, collaboration or other joined work, it is possible to share your Workflow with other users.  A Workflow can be (1) shared globally with all MoveApps users or (2) specific users can be invited by their nickname. The recipients can load the privately shared or any public Workflow into their account and edit it there independently of the original Workflow and its creator. The Workflow will be available with all Apps in the same versions as shared by the creator originally, they can be updated by the receiving user (however, without the option to go back). Note that users have 30 days to accept an individually shared Workflow, public Workflows stay available permanently. 

## How to share your Workflow

To share one of your Workflows, you need to select `Share` in the Workflow menu at the Workflow overview. In the Share Workflow dialog you then have fill in several details.

First, define with whom you want to share your Workflow. You can select to `Share with all users on MoveApps` and/or select one or more specific MoveApps users by searching for their nicknames, that you should personally ask of the person(s) beforehand. Only users that have agreed that their nicknames can be used for this option during the registration process can be found here. It is possible to update this setting in the user profile. In case of specific users being invited to receive a shared workflow, they will receive an E-mail about the invitation.

Second, you can select which of the Workflow instances you want to share. The selection of at least one of them is mandatory.

Third, there are two kinds of messages that you can provide to the Workflow recipient(s). One is a general, free text message that allows you to describe your Workflow and point out why you are sharing it. The other is the Datasource Message, which is by default filled in with the settings of the data source selection App of all selected Workflow instances. This allows the new user to download the same data from e.g. Movebank as the original user, but with his/her private account. The data message appears during the configuration of the Movebank Download App once the workflow has been loaded/accepted (see below), so that the user can easily adapt it. Note, that the data source details can be edited, replaced or deleted before sharing.

Finally, it is possible to add a link to a workflow, which can, for example, point towards a description of the workflow, a paper that is using it or a more thorough methods description.

Once finished, please press Share Workflow.

!\> Note that as the original `owner` of a public workflow, you can edit the title and description of the workflow and all shared workflow instances, the share message and workflow references/links at any time under `Details` in the public workflow table (use edit button at the top).

## How to accept a shared Workflow

If a Workflow has been shared with you by another MoveApps user it will appear below in the Workflow overview. It states the nickname of the user that invited you, the names of the Workflow and Workflow instances as well as both messages. You can decline or accept the invitation. At acceptance the Workflow will be added to your account's list. Note that at the bottom of the Workflow invitation it is indicated for how long it will stay available for you to accept. When adding a shared workflow to your dashboard , it appears in the Category `Imported Privately Shared Workflow`. The category can be adapted afterwards.

## How to find and add public Workflows

All available public Workflows are listed below your Workflow invitations in the Workflow overview. They can be searched for by the Workflow title, description, host user nickname and Workflow instance titles and descriptions.  See the provided details (title, description, shared by, publish date and details) and press `Add` if you want to add it to your list of Workflows. This will create a local copy of the Workflow that you can independently edit. The added public workflow will initially be stored in the Category `Imported Public Shared Workflows`, which can be adapted afterwards. All public workflow details pages have stable links that can be used for communication.

## Configuration of data source Apps in added Workflows

If accepting a public or privately shared workflow into your dashboard, it is important to realise that any data source Apps (Movebank, Movebank Non-Loc or Cloud Storage Upload) need to be configured, before the workflow can be run. This is important to keep data integrity and security. A pop-up message is pointing this out when adding the workflow to your dashboard.

In the workflow instance view, all data source Apps show a blue message that the data source settings have to be configured. If a red dot is attached to it, the App has not been configured at all. When clicking the message, one is directed to the settings of the App and can configure them according to the data source message that is presented on the left of the window. Once all data source Apps of all Instances of the accepted workflow have been configured, the data source message can be deleted and the blue message indication will disappear from the Apps in the workflow instance view.

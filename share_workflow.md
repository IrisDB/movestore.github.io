# Share Workflows with other Users

For replication, collaboration or other joined work, it is possible to share your Workflow with other users.  A Workflow can be (1) shared globally with all MoveApps users or (2) specific users can be invited by their nickname. The receipients can load the shared or any public Workflow into their account and edit it there independently of the original Workflow and its creator. The Workflow will be availabe with all Apps in the same versions as shared by the creator originally, they can be updated by the receiving user. Note that users have 30 days to accept an individually shared Workflow, public Workflows stay available permanently.

## How to share your Workflow

To share one of your Workflows, you need to select `Share` in the Workflow menu at the Workflow overview. In the Share Workflow dialog you then have fill in several details.

First, define with whom you want to share your Workflow. You can select to `Share with all users on MoveApps` and/or select one or more specific MoveApps users by searching for their nicknames, that you should personally ask of the person(s) beforehand. Only users that have agreed that their nicknames can be used for this option during the registration process can be found here. It is possible to update this setting in the user profile. In case of specific users being invited to receive a shared workflow, they will receive an E-mail about the invitation.

Second, you can select which of the Workflow instances you want to share. The selection of at least one of them is mandatory.

Finally, there are two kinds of messages that you can provide to the Workflow receipient(s). One is a general, free text message that allows you to describe your Workflow and point out why you are sharing it. The other is the Datasource Message, which is by default filled in with the settings of the data source selection App of all selected Workflow instances. This allows the new user to download the same data from e.g. Movebank as the original user, but with his/her private account. The data message also appears during the configuration of the Movebank Download App once the workflow has been loaded/accepted (see below), so that the user can easily adapt it. Note, that the data source details can be edited, replaced or deleted before sharing.

Once finished, please press Share Workflow.

It states the nickname of the user that invited you, the names of the Workflow and Workflow instances as well as both meassages. You can decline or accept the invitation.

## How to find and add public Workflows

All available public Workflows are listed below your Workflow invitations in the Workflow overview. The most recent public Workflows are listed directly, all can be searched for. The search criteria include the Workflow title, description, host user nickname and Workflow instance titles and descriptions.  See the provided details (title, description, shared by, message and publish date) and press `Add` if you want to add it to your list of Workflows. This will create a local copy of the Workflow that you can independently edit.

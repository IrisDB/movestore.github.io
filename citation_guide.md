# Citation Guidelines

The following guidelines and examples are provided for App developers and App users to ensure appropriate citation of Apps, Workflows and analysis results from MoveApps. Because users retain ownership of their Apps in MoveApps, references to “MoveApps Workflow” or “software accessed through MoveApps” are insufficient. Proper citation or other attribution will depend on the App developer’s applicable software license, or whether the Workflow is public or published in the [MoveApps repository](www.datarepository.movebank.org).

Read the [general MoveApps terms of use](terms_of_use.md) for more on how to use and refer to Apps and Workflows available on MoveApps.

## Cite MoveApps Apps

Most commonly, users will cite a MoveApps App or Workflow within the text and reference list of a paper or report.

### Reference lists

For single Apps please use the recommended [citation](cite_app.md) as given in de App details to include as reference in your text. Furthermore, the App developer might want you to cite related papers of research projects. Refer to the license terms and details in the respective [App documentation](files/README_template.md).

Workflows that have been published in the MoveApps Repository have a DOI that serves as a persistent link to the Workflow and Apps as well as the recommended citations for both the data and paper describing it. See `doi link NA` for the following example:

Kölzsch A, Safi K, Kruckenberg H, Wikelski M. 2021. Workflow from: Variability of winter night roosts in geese. MoveApps Data Repository. `doi link NA`

### In-text citations

To cite Workflows not published in the MoveApps Repository, it is best to include both the public Workflow name and its containing Apps, along with the date accessed, for example

*The analysis used in this study was performed on MoveApps (www.moveapps.org, Workflow name 'Night roost variability', App names 'Movebank', 'Remove Outlier', 'Filter by Season', 'Roost Sites') on [date].*

To cite Workflows published in the MoveApps Repository, you can simply include the reference (e.g. Kölzsch et al. 2021) or a more complete description, for example

*The analysis methods used in this study are available on MoveApps (www.moveapps.org, Workflow name 'Night roost variability') and are published in the MoveApps Repository (Kölzsch et al. 2021).*

## Cite MoveApps

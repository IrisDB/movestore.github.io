# Citation Guidelines

The following guidelines and examples are provided for App developers and App users to ensure appropriate citation of Apps, Workflows and analysis results from MoveApps. Because users retain ownership of their Apps and Workflows in MoveApps, references to “MoveApps App”, “MoveApps Workflow” or “software accessed through MoveApps” are insufficient. Proper citation or other attribution will depend on the App developer’s applicable software license, or whether the Workflow is public or published in the [Movebank Data Repository](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/).

Read the [general MoveApps terms](terms_of_use.md) for more on how to use and refer to Apps and Workflows available on MoveApps.


## Cite MoveApps Apps

Most commonly, users will cite a MoveApps App or Workflow within the text and reference list of a paper or report.


### Reference lists

For single Apps please use the [citation button](cite_app.md) to create a recommended reference to include in your text. Furthermore, the App developer might want you to cite related papers of research projects. Refer to the license terms and details in the App documentation.

Workflows that have been published in the Movebank Data Repository have a DOI that serves as a persistent link to the Workflow and Apps as well as the recommended citations for both the data and paper describing it.


### In-text citations

To cite Workflows not published in the Movebank Data Repository, it is best to include both the public Workflow name and its containing Apps, along with the date accessed, for example

*The analysis used in this study was performed on MoveApps (www.moveapps.org, Workflow name 'Migration mapper - Spring migration', App names 'Movebank', 'Remove Outlier', 'Filter Data by Season', 'Thin Data by Time', 'Segment Data by Speed', 'Segment Raster Plot') on [date].*

To cite Workflows published in the Movebank Data Repository, you can simply include the reference (e.g. Darwin et al. 2021) or a more complete description, for example

*The analysis methods used in this study are available on MoveApps (www.moveapps.org, Workflow name 'Migration mapper - Spring migration') and are published in the Movebank Data Repository (Darwin et al. 2021).*
